          No challenge is more daunting than facing our own weakness. We exist
          to wage war against our fears and failures, to overcome every obstacle
          we encounter and realize the dreams we have envisioned.

          With the right people around you there's no limit to how far you can
          go.

          No matter how strong we started, we push forward chasing a more
          ambitious tomorrow. Our strength and skills show others what is
          possible. Once we have conquered ourselves, all that remains is to be
          a beacon to others.
